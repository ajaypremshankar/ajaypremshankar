## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- **Python**:
  - Why?
    -  To improve my ability to write scripts/POCs faster. Got introduced to Jupyter Notebooks at work which motivated me to learn python better.
    -  Over the years, java has become a "language of work" for me. Python feels like fresh breath of air.
    -  Learning python brings back fun of learning a new language.
