## 🌱 I’m currently learning ... [Oct-2024]
- **Python**:
  - Why?
    -  To improve my ability to write scripts/POCs faster. Got introduced to Jupyter Notebooks at work which motivated me to learn python better.
    -  Over the years, java has become a "language of work" for me. Python feels like fresh breath of air.
    -  Learning python brings back fun of learning a new language.
   
- **Vim Motions** [Nov-2024]
  - While this mostly feels like waste of time. I want to experience what all the fuss is about?
  - Learning with LazyVim, if I get comfortable I would like write a barebones version of LazyVim 🤞🏽🤞🏽
 
- System Design Concepts (by implementing the concepts) [Nov-2024]
  - Capturing my learnings [here](https://github.com/ajaypremshankar/building-barebones-systems)
