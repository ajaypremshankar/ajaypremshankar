### Namaste 🙏



## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- [Writing git commands ground up](https://github.com/ajaypremshankar/py-git): In pursuit to learn **GIT Internals** better.
- [Writing barebones **HTTP server** ground up](https://github.com/ajaypremshankar/barebones-http-server): In pursuit to learn **how HTTP protocol works**.



## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- **Python**:
  - Why?
    -  To improve my ability to write scripts/POCs faster. Got introduced to Jupyter Notebooks at work which motivated me to learn python better.
    -  Over the years, java has become a "language of work" for me. Python feels like fresh breath of air.
    -  Learning python brings back fun of learning a language.
