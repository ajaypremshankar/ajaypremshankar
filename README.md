### Namaste 🙏



## 🔭 I’m currently writing ...
- [git commands ground up](https://github.com/ajaypremshankar/py-git): In pursuit to learn **GIT Internals** better. [Oct-2024]
- [barebones **HTTP server** ground up](https://github.com/ajaypremshankar/barebones-http-server): In pursuit to learn **how HTTP protocol works**. [Oct-2024]
- [simple redis server](https://github.com/ajaypremshankar/barebones-redis): To better understand how redis works internally [Nov-2024]



## 🌱 I’m currently learning ... [Oct-2024]
- **Python**:
  -  To improve my ability to write scripts/POCs faster. Got introduced to Jupyter Notebooks at work which motivated me to learn python better.
  -  Over the years, java has become a "language of work" for me. Python feels like fresh breath of air.
  -  Learning python brings back fun of learning a new language.
   
- **Vim Motions** [Nov-2024]
  - While this mostly feels like waste of time. I want to experience what all the fuss is about?
  - Learning with LazyVim, if I get comfortable I would like write a barebones version of LazyVim 🤞🏽🤞🏽
 
- **System Design Concepts** (by implementing basic version) [Nov-2024]
  - This is to build habit of learning by doing, I struggle to learn tech just by reading.
  - Capturing my learnings [here](https://github.com/ajaypremshankar/building-barebones-systems)
